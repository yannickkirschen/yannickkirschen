<h4>:rocket: These are some of my software projects</h4>

- [digital-rail](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/digital-rail): A digital interlocking system for model railways.
- [ddir](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/ddir): A tool to create a diff of two directories and sync changes. I have developed this to backup my photos.
- [tidydev](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/tidydev): A tiny tool to analyze my development directory and clean it up.

At vocational school, I implemented [chess](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/chess) in Java. And at university, a fellow student and I did a research project on a [interlocking system](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/study-project) for a LEGO® railway.
