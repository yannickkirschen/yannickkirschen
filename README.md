<h2 align="center">Hi :wave:, I'm Yannick</h2>
<h4 align="center">Junior Software Engineer at REWE digital GmbH and DHBW Mannheim based in Cologne</h4>

- :star: I’m currently working on an automation project for my **LEGO® railway** and in this context **interlocking systems**.
- :office: At work I deal with **Java** (Java SE, Jakarta EE, Spring Boot), **GitLab**, **Kubernetes**, **Linux** (RHEL, Ansible, Shell).
- :mag: I’m currently learning **C**, **railways**, **interlocking systems**.
- :speech_balloon: *I have no special talent. I'm just passionately curious. - Albert Einstein*
- In :heart: with **Java** :coffee:, **Railways** :steam_locomotive: and **Nature** :deciduous_tree:

I enjoy photography :camera: as well. My favorite line of code is in the Apollo Guidance Computer: [LUNAR_LANDING_GUIDANCE_EQUATIONS.agc#L179](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11/blob/27e2acf88a6345e2b1064c8b006a154363937050/Luminary099/LUNAR_LANDING_GUIDANCE_EQUATIONS.agc#L179).

<h4>:rocket: These are some of my software projects</h4>

- [digital-rail](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/digital-rail): Computer based interlocking for model railways. (Currently, I develop a new CBI using Golang)
- [ddir](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/ddir): A tool to create a diff of two directories and sync changes. I have developed this to backup my photos.
- [tidydev](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/tidydev): A tiny tool to analyze my development directory and clean it up.

At vocational school, I implemented [chess](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/chess) in Java. And at university, a fellow student and I did a research project on an interlocking system called [mini-rail](https://github.com/yannickkirschen/study-project) for a LEGO® railway.
